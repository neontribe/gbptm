            </h2>
            <h3>Who Can Join The Scheme?</h3>
            <p>Businesses of all sizes can join the scheme.</p>
            <h3>What are the requirements of joining the scheme?</h3>
            <p>
              Participating businesses should allow customers and non customers
              alike to access their toilet facilities during normal opening
              hours and display stickers to make people aware of their
              participation in the scheme. There is an expectation that
              facilities will be maintained to acceptable standards of hygiene
              and cleanliness.
            </p>
            <h3>Why was this scheme created?</h3>
            <p>
              Over the past two decades, the number of public toilets available
              throughout the UK have been steadily reduced. There is currently
              no legal requirement for local authorities to provide toilets.
              This often leads to loos being closed if councils deem they cannot
              afford the cost to maintain. This presents a struggle for the many
              individuals and families who have a greater need for access to
              public facilities; itâ€™s also a basic human need for us all. The
              Use Our Loos scheme has been designed to bring the public loos
              back by opening more loos through cafes, restaurants, and shops,
              where facilities already exist.
            </p>
            <p>
              Community Toilet Schemes have been run successfully at a local
              level across the country but the public are often unaware of their
              existence. By bringing these schemes under one umbrella, as well
              as welcoming new members we hope to increase the value for
              everyone.
            </p>
            <h3>Does this scheme aim to replace traditional public toilets?</h3>
            <p>
              No. Purpose built public toilets serve an important role in public
              life, and we will continue to encourage councils to increase
              rather than cut provision. This scheme aims to find a
              community-oriented solution to filling the gaps in current
              provision.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Can Businesses also participate in Local Community Toilet Schemes?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Yes! The Use Our Loos Campaign is not intended to replace existing
              schemes run by local authorities. We aim to unite existing schemes
              with a common and recognizable brand to enable the public to
              access them more easily. For areas where local schemes exist
              businesses are encouraged to sign up to both.
            </p>
            <h3>What if a dangerous situation arises in my loo?</h3>
            <p>
              Businesses reserve the right to manage situations as they would
              with any customer to their establishment, including escalating
              issues as needed.
            </p>
            <h3>What if I want to leave the scheme?</h3>
            <p>
              Businesses can leave the scheme at any time by contacting the
              campaign manager and asking to be removed from the map.
