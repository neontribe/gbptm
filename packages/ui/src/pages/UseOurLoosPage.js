          <Heading headingLevel={3}>Who Can Join The Scheme?</Heading>
          <p>Businesses of all sizes can join the scheme.</p>
          <Heading headingLevel={3}>
            What are the requirements of joining the scheme?
          </Heading>
          <p>
            Participating businesses should allow customers and non customers
            alike to access their toilet facilities during normal opening hours
            and display stickers to make people aware of their participation in
            the scheme. There is an expectation that facilities will be
            maintained to acceptable standards of hygiene and cleanliness.
          </p>
          <Heading headingLevel={3}>Why was this scheme created?</Heading>
          <p>
            Over the past two decades, the number of public toilets available
            throughout the UK have been steadily reduced. There is currently no
            legal requirement for local authorities to provide toilets. This
            often leads to loos being closed if councils deem they cannot afford
            the cost to maintain. This presents a struggle for the many
            individuals and families who have a greater need for access to
            public facilities; itâ€™s also a basic human need for us all. The Use
            Our Loos scheme has been designed to bring the public loos back by
            opening more loos through cafes, restaurants, and shops, where
            facilities already exist.
          </p>
          <p>
            Community Toilet Schemes have been run successfully at a local level
            across the country but the public are often unaware of their
            existence. By bringing these schemes under one umbrella, as well as
            welcoming new members we hope to increase the value for everyone.
          </p>
          <Heading headingLevel={3}>
            Does this scheme aim to replace traditional public toilets?
          </Heading>
          <p>
            No. Purpose built public toilets serve an important role in public
            life, and we will continue to encourage councils to increase rather
            than cut provision. This scheme aims to find a community-oriented
            solution to filling the gaps in current provision.
          </p>
          <Heading headingLevel={3}>
            Can Businesses also participate in Local Community Toilet Schemes?
          </Heading>
          <p>
            Yes! The Use Our Loos Campaign is not intended to replace existing
            schemes run by local authorities. We aim to unite existing schemes
            with a common and recognizable brand to enable the public to access
            them more easily. For areas where local schemes exist businesses are
            encouraged to sign up to both.
          </p>
          <h3>What if a dangerous situation arises in my loo?</h3>
          <p>
            Businesses reserve the right to manage situations as they would with
            any customer to their establishment, including escalating issues as
            needed.
          </p>
          <Heading headingLevel={3}>
            What if I want to leave the scheme?
          </Heading>
          <p>
            Businesses can leave the scheme at any time by contacting the
            campaign manager and asking to be removed from the map.
