        <p>
          A publicly-accessible toilet means any toilet that the public all
          allowed to access without needing to be a customer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Public toilets:
          <ul className={lists.inset}>
            <li>Council-run toilets and other public toilet blocks</li>
            <li>
              Toilets in train stations, bus stations, service/petrol stations,
              tube stations, ferry terminals, airports and other transport
              networks
            </li>
            <li>Shopping centre toilets</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          Other publicly-accessible toilets:
          <ul className={lists.inset}>
            <li>
              Toilets in public buildings, such as town halls, libraries,
              hospitals, museums and leisure centres
            </li>
            <li>
              Toilets in other businesses where the business agrees that the
              public can use their toilets without having to buy anything. These
              are often part of Community Toilet Schemes (run by councils) and
              can include shops, cafes, supermarkets, restaurants, hotels and
              pubs
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            We try not to show toilets where you need to ask permission to use
            it
          </strong>, such as those that are for customers-only. The exception is
          platform-side toilets at stations. These are only accessible to
          ticket-holders but we feel it is useful information to include.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anyone can go on the website and{' '}
          <strong>add, edit or remove toilets</strong>. We also use open data
