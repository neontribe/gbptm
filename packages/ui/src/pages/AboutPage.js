                We all need toilets. When you need to go, you need to go. At
                home or in an office this isn’t a problem. However, out and
                about, are you sure there’s somewhere to go when the need
                arises?
              </p>

              <p>
                Across the UK, more than one in every three public toilets have
                been closed over the last two decades. Some councils are already
                without a single free-to-use public convenience.

                the ambition to unlock the loos that are hidden in high street
                cafes, restaurants, coffee shops and bars and open them up to
                the community.

              <p>
                As more public loos are closed, we’re asking that more loos are
                made public.
              </p>

              <p>
                We’re inviting businesses to sign up and welcome everyone,
                customers and non-customers, to use their loos. In return, we’re
                providing them with free Domestos product, directing people to
                their venues and driving local fame so they will benefit from
                increased customers and a stronger connection to their
                community.
              </p>

              <p>
                We’re inviting the public to use our map to discover loos near
                them and to help us improve the service by adding new locations
                or flagging loos that have closed.
